# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I have created this project to collect my notes while completing the prework for my bootcamp course.  There is a lot of new information to be learned and this will allow there to be one place for the highlight information to be collected.  Throughout building the webpage I have learned the basics realted to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the use of GitHUB and Git flow.  This process also gave me an introduction on what we will be focusing on throuhout the boot camp course.

When the DevTools console is opened (Command+Option+I for macos) (Control+Shift+I for Windows), you can see that JavaScript is running under the console panel and will also suggest randomly what topic to start with first.
